# Smart Crop Image IA WordPress Plugin
This plugin uses the power of machine learning to automatically re-center hard-cropped image sizes (sometimes called image thumbnails) in WordPress. 

Re-cropped images can be previewed first to see if you preferred the re-cropped version.

You will need a free Google Cloud Vision API key to use this plugin. Find out how to get started [[here](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/setup)].
