Use the power of machine learning to crop images automatically. 

== Description ==

If your WordPress website uses "hard cropped" image sizes/thumbnails you may find this plugin useful. A hard cropped image is one where parts of the original image have been removed. Sometimes this means the most important part of the image is gone. Frustrating!  

Smart Crop Image AI plugin solves all that -- automagically! Using the power of artificial intelligence, easily re-crop badly cropped images to get the "perfect" crop. 


== Features ==

* Automagically crop not only to faces, but whatever the "main focus" of an image is, based on Google's kabillion machine years of knowledge
* Preview smart crops before saving them
* Search for images to crop by file name
* Adds a smart crop button to individual media files as well
* Only displays images that are hard-cropped
* Compatible with thumbnail regeneration and image optimziation plugins 

== How Does It Work? ==

This plugin uses the Google Cloud Vision API to guess the perfect crop for an image. It requires a Google Cloud Vision API key, which is free and can be acquired [here](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/setup). As of 2021, the first 1000 requests per month are free.

== Is It Compatible With Image Optimization Plugins? ==

If the optimization plugin optimizes individual image sizes and resaves them to your WordPress site, then yes. If the plugin generates the image sizes for you, maybe not. 

== Is It Compatible with WebP? ==

Probably not. If your webp images are generated by an optimization plugin, which selectively loads them depending on whether a browser supports webp, they probably won't be accessible by this one. 

== Is It Compatible with Retina? ==

Probably not.
